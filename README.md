              Algotihm that simulates a molecular motor

Hello, this is my project which attemp to simulate a molecular motor. It is an easy example of how we can start working on simulating molecular motors with python. 

The work focuses on designing the movement mechanism of a motor protein, through 
a simulation programmed in python using structured programming and use the randomness from single particle trajectories, based on a model 
called, totally asymmetric simple exclusion processes (TASEP). The number of iterations can be changed as needed.

The process provides an gif at the end where simulation process is shown.

If want to know a little bit about the background of this specific molecular motor, the full explanation is on https://carolinalderete.blogspot.com/#

If you have questions, comments or feedback would be a pleasure. carolinalderete@hotmail.com
